1.Covariance and correlation 
Children of three ages are asked to indicate their preference for three photographs of adults. Do the data suggest that there is a significant relationship between age and photograph preference? What is wrong with this study?

                                                                        Photograph:
                         Age of child               A                      B                      C
         				   5-6 years:      18                     22                     20

                                    7-8 years:         2                    28                     40

                                    9-10 years:     20                     10                     40

1.	Use cov() to calculate the sample covariance between B  and  C.
2.	Use another call to cov() to calculate the sample covariance matrix for the preferences.
3.	Use cor() to calculate the sample correlation between B and C.
4.	Use another call to cor() to calculate the sample correlation matrix for the preferences.


# Create a matrix for the data
data <- matrix(c(18, 2, 20, 22, 28, 10, 20, 40, 40), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(data) <- c("5-6 years", "7-8 years", "9-10 years")
colnames(data) <- c("A", "B", "C")

# Calculate covariance between B and C
cov_bc <- cov(data[, "B"], data[, "C"])
print(paste("Covariance between B and C:", cov_bc))

# Calculate sample covariance matrix for the preferences
cov_matrix <- cov(data)
print("Sample Covariance Matrix:")
print(cov_matrix)

# Calculate correlation between B and C
cor_bc <- cor(data[, "B"], data[, "C"])
print(paste("Correlation between B and C:", cor_bc))

# Calculate sample correlation matrix for the preferences
cor_matrix <- cor(data)
print("Sample Correlation Matrix:")
print(cor_matrix)
